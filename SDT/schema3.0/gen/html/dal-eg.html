	This device is intended as a demonstration of how to use the
	abstract modules defined in the HGI Core domain. The
	vendor has provided a proprietry module with two operations
	on and off. This is clearly a candidate for the 
	module class BooleanState.
      

      
	
	  
	    The proprietry interface for turning the switch on and off. 
	    Actions for setting the state to on or off 
	    and for querying the state.
